Fast 360 Video Compression for IoT Camera Sensing

Here is our documentation for our research.

We use MATLAB code to pre-process the saliency data.

We use Python code to pre-process the DCT data.

Definitions:
DCT means
Saliency means
x264 codec is
Machine learning is
Linear regression is
Preprocessing means
Virtual machine is
VirtualBox is
Ubuntu is
Python is
MATLAB is



The code that we modified in the x264 source code + problems:

The datasets that we used were gotten from:

Advice for future REU researchers:
-Set milestones, set concrete achievable goals, delegate tasks, make sure that everyone knows what is going on, create documentation along the way, COMMENT YOUR CODE

What we need for documentation:
-Map of the workflow. label figures.
-Code, and what each of the codes do, like a walkthrough
-Explanations of what all the parts are useful for.
-biggest problems in the workflow
-what needs to be done to expand the research
-github repository for our code
-readme file
-all of the datasets
-sources cited
-blog posts
